"""
A program that plays the 'cows and bulls' game with the user. The game works like this:
Randomly generate a 4-digit number. The user enters a 4-digit number. 
For every digit that the user guessed correctly in the correct place, they have a 'cow'. 
For every digit the user guessed correctly in the wrong place is a 'bull'. 
Every time the user makes a guess, you tell them how many 'cows' and 'bulls' they have.
